## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I participate individually or as part of a team?**  
Yes. You may compete either as an individual or within a team, but not both. Each participant can belong to only one team for the duration of the competition.

**Can I choose only some tasks to participate in?**  
Yes. You may submit to any subset of tasks. Tasks without submissions will simply be scored as zero.

**Do I need to submit my model?**  
No. In the test phase, invited teams will submit both results and code. The organisers will verify that the code can reproduce the submitted results within the allowed resources (one A100 GPU, 24 hours).

**Will my submitted code be shared publicly?**  
No. All submitted code will remain private and will be used only for verification.
