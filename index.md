title: Anti-BAD Challenge
---

This is the official website of the Anti-BAD Challenge, an IEEE SaTML 2026 competition. The competition aims to advance the understanding and development of methods for detecting hidden functionality in large language models (LLMs). The competition features practical constraints faced by end-users in realistic deployment scenarios and encourages the development of lightweight, generalizable strategies for securing LLMs under constrained post-training settings with minimal data and training assumptions.

## Challenge Overview

The **Anti-BAD: An Anti-Backdoor Challenge for Post-Trained Large Language Models** is a competition designed to address the growing security concerns in the era of widespread LLM deployment.

As obtaining and deploying language models from public hubs like HuggingFace becomes common practice, the risk of backdoor attacks increases. Malicious attackers can inject backdoors into models through fine-tuning on poisoned datasets or model editing, then publish these compromised models. The lack of transparency and model verification in current practices raises significant security concerns.

This challenge focuses on practical constraints faced by end-users in realistic deployment scenarios. Unlike existing defenses that require large-scale data and compute resources, Anti-BAD encourages the development of lightweight, generalizable strategies for securing LLMs under constrained post-training settings with minimal data and training assumptions.

The competition is designed to foster constrained post-training settings with minimal data and training assumptions. It encourages defenses—whether adapting traditional methods or introducing novel ones—to evaluate their effectiveness under a fair benchmark. To broaden its impact, the challenge spans widely used LLM scenarios, including generation, classification, and multilingual tasks.
