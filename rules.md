## Frequently Asked Questions

### Registration and Participation

**How can I join the competition?**
The competition is hosted on [**Codabench**](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/11188/). To participate, register on the platform and join our competition. For detailed instructions, please refer to the official Codabench wiki: [Participating in a Competition](https://github.com/codalab/codabench/wiki/User_Participating-in-a-Competition). See the [**Getting Started**](/startkit/) page for setup instructions.

**Can I participate individually or as part of a team?**
Yes. You may compete either as an individual or as part of a team. Each participant can only belong to one team throughout the competition. There is no strict limit on team size.

**How do I form a team on Codabench?**
Teams are managed through Codabench organizations. To create a team:
1. Select "Create an Organization" from your account dropdown menu.
2. Invite team members using the "Edit Organization" button.
3. Invited members must accept the email invitation to join.
4. As the team leader (owner), adjust member permissions from "Member" to "Participant" to enable team submissions.

Note: Organizations are platform-wide and can be used across all Codabench competitions.

### Submissions

**How do I submit as a team?**
On the "My Submissions" page:
1. Submit your solution either as yourself or as your organization.
2. All your submissions will appear together in your submission history, regardless of submission type.
3. Select one submission from your history to add to the leaderboard.
4. The leaderboard will display your individual username (if submitted as yourself) or the organization name (if submitted as your organization).

Note: Each organization member can independently select a submission to display on the leaderboard as the organization. If multiple team members select submissions as the organization, multiple entries with the same organization name will appear on the leaderboard. All submissions are private and visible only to you and the competition administrators—even your teammates cannot see your submission history.

**How long will it take to receive my score after submission?**
Submissions are evaluated on the Codabench server. The total time includes both queue time and evaluation time, which is not fixed but typically takes 10-20 minutes based on our experiments. After evaluation completes, detailed score breakdowns for each task will be accessible in the submission entry log, enabling you to analyze and adjust your approach.

**Can I choose only some tasks to participate in?**
Yes. You may submit to any subset of tasks. Tasks without submissions will simply be scored as zero. See the [**Challenge**](/challenge/) page for evaluation details.

**Do I need to submit my model?**
No. In the development phase, you only need to submit prediction result files to receive scores. In the test phase, teams who participated in the development phase may submit both results and code. The organizers will verify that the code can reproduce the submitted results within the allowed resources (one A100 GPU, 24 hours).

**Will my submitted code be shared publicly?**
No. All submitted code will remain private and will be used only for verification.

**Where can I ask questions or get updates?**
You can reach the organizers through:
